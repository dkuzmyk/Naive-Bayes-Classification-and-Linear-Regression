        "Naive Bayes classification is a fast and simple classification method. Its efficiency stems from some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the conditional independence of features. Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n",

Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$. \n",

        "You may have noticed that the classes are heavily imbalanced. There are only 747 `spam` messages, compared with 4827 `ham` messages. If a classifier simply predicts all messages as `ham`, it will get around 86% accuracy (pretty high). Therefore, accuracy is not a good metric in this case for evaluating the performance of the classifier. As we did before, we can use F-score metrics. But this time we will not implement it from the scratch. Instead, we will learn how to use the builtin methods from `scikit`. [Here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics) is a summary of well-implemented and commonly used metrics for evaluating the quality of a model's predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this task, you need to **report** the testing accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score of the Naive Bayes method by choosing proper functions from `scikit` to compute those metrics with required arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hint: you need to import methods from `sklearn.metrics` before using them."

ROC tells us how good the model is for distinguishing the given classes, in term of the **predicted probability** (not the final hard label in pos/neg). A typical ROC curve has False Positive Rate (FPR) on the $x$-axis and True Positive Rate (TPR) on the $y$-axis. To obtain the FPR and TPR, you can use the `roc_curve` method from `scikit`. This `roc_curve` function takes two arguments: 1) the ground truth labels of the test examples, and 2) the predicted probability that each example is positive. It returns the FPR and TPR which can be used for plotting.\n",

        "In this section, we will explore linear regression model. The dataset we will use for this section is Wine Qualuty, whose description can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). This dataset contains **4898** examples, each containing **11** features (the first 11 columns), and the **last** (12-th) column is the value we want to predict. The dataset can be downloaded here [`winequality-white.csv`](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~zhangx/teaching/winequality-white.csv) (our code will download it directly). \n",
        "\n",
        "Different from classification models, a regression model is used to predict real values rather than the category an example belongs to. Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between features and real value target. To perform supervised learning, we represent the hypothesis as a linear function of features ($x$) to predict the output ($y$).\n",
        "\n",

        "Here $\\theta_i$'s are the **parameters** parameterizing the space of linear functions mapping from $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathcal{Y}$. Our goal is to **learn** these parameters so that we can find a linear function in this hypothesis space to estimate the output $y$.\n",
        "\n",
        "To simplify the notation and ease the computation, we **pad** the input $x$ by letting $x_0=1$. That is, for an example with three features $x=[x_1, x_2, x_3]$, the padded feature vector will be $x=[1,x_1, x_2, x_3]$. Then, the linear function can be written as:\n",

        "where on the right-hand side above we are viewing $\\theta$ and $x$ both as vectors, and here $n = 11$ is the number of features. \n",
        "\n",
        "Given a training set, the way to learn these parameters is to make $f_\\theta(x)$ close to $y$. To measure the closeness, we use Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) here. The loss function can therefore be defined as:\n",

        "where the superscript $(i)$ denotes the $i$-th example, \n",

        "Once we have received the dataset, we first need to preprocess it.  Very often, the features in a dataset are of very different scale, which can slow down the optimization for Eq (10). To accelerate it, we need to normalize each feature by substracting its mean value, and then dividing by its standard deviation (std). Assuming $X_i = [x_i^{(1)}, ... , x_i^{(m)}]$ is the $i$-th feature in the training set (across the $m$ examples), the normalized feature $i$ for the $j$-th training example can be computed by:\n",

After executing all commands and completing this notebook, save your `Lab_2.ipynb` as a PDF file, named as `X_Y_UIN.pdf`, where `X` is your first name, `Y` is your last name, and `UIN` is your UIN. Make sure that your PDF file includes all parts of your solution, including the plots. \n",
